    <div class="intro">
      <p>Hello, my name is Keith I was born in New York. I'm currently a student attending Code Fellows in Seattle. I've spent a combined total of sixteen years in the military. Ten years in the Marine Corps as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Scout_Sniper" target=" _blank">Scout Sniper</a>, to include a few years as an <a href="http://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Units/Northeast/Weapons-Training-Battalion/Scout-Sniper-Instructor-School/" target="_blank">S.S.B.C.</a> instructor.  I eventually transitioned into the Army where my career was cut short due to injury. I've always had an interest in technology so becoming a programmer seemed to be a wise career choice.</p>
