       <p>Hello, my name is Keith and I'm currently a student at Code Fellows in Seattle.  I come from a military background.  I spent ten years in the Marine Corps as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STA_platoon" target=" _blank">S.T.A.</a> team member. I also did a few years as an S.S.B.C. instructor.  I eventually transitioned to the Army and finished out my career with just six years due to injury. I've always had an interest in technology so becoming a programmer seemed to be a wise career choice.</p>
